## Abstract


## Introduction


Bioinformatic data sets, such as genomic data, are sufficiently large that visual inspection is not practical.
This presents a need to summarize and process large data sets for quality control.
Solutions exist for some, but not all steps in workflows.
For example, the software FastQC [@andrews2010fastqc; @bioinformatics2011fastqc] summarizes raw sequencing reads in the FASTQ format that are a typical result from Illumina sequencing.
The trimmomatic [@bolger2014trimmomatic] attempts to remove nucleotides from low quality Illumina sequencing data.
In order to infer whether gene space has been well assembled BUSCO [@seppey2019busco] queries for conserved genes from several databases throughout the phylogenetic tree of life.
Blobtools [@laetsch2017blobtools] uses GC content and read coverage to attempt to improve assemblies.


[@leggett2013sequencing]


A commonly reported summary of a genome is the N50 statistic.
This can be calculated by summing the number of nucleotides in an assembly and dividing by two to get the midpoint.
Then sort the sequences from longest to shortest and starting from the longest sequence traverse the sequences until the midpoint of the sequences has been reached.
The length of the sequence that contains the midpoint is the N50.
While this statistic is commonly reported it does have shortcomings, which is perhaps why several alternatives have been proposed.
One shortcoming is that it is a single number that is attempting to summarize millions or billions of nucleotides, so some may see it as an over simplification.
Another is that it is sensitive to the minimum reporting length in fragmented genomes.
Assemblies based on Illumina data, or other fragmented assemblies, typically contain a large number of short sequences.
How short is determined by a minimum length of sequence to report in the final version.
If we take an assembly with a minimum reporting length of 100 bp and remove all sequences that are less than 500 bp it will increase the N50.
This is because we are reducing the number of nucleotides in the assembly by removing short sequences.
The N50 statistic has been very useful but more informative summaries could provide more informative perspectives.


We present fasta2nuccomp, a pair of scripts intended to summarize the content of FASTA format files that contain nucleotides.
These scripts consist of a python script that summarizes the FASTA file in a tabular format and an RMarkdown script that numerically and graphically summarize the tabular data.
Together, these scripts provide a rapid way to summarize the contents of FASTA files and present this information in publication quality graphics.


## Methods


The repository fasta2nuccomp contains a python script, and RMarkdown script, example data and example output.
The python script takes a FASTA format file consisting of nucleotides as input.
The python (3.8.2) script uses biopython [@cock2009biopython] to read in the file and to collect the length, as well as the (case sensitive) number of nucleotides and IUPAC ambiguous nucleotides.
This information is output to a comma delimited text file.
This script can be run independently or, on systems with bash (typical *nix systems), can be called from the RMarkdown script.
The RMarkdown [@rmarkdown] script uses R [@R] and reads in the comma delimited text file and summarizes it.
Graphical summaries are made using ggplot2 [@ggplot2] and ggpubr [@ggpubr] and consist of histograms of A, T, G, and C content, length of sequences, IUPAC ambiguity nucleotides (excluding A, C, G, T, and N), undetermined nucleotides (N), as well as a sanity check for unexpected characters.
Numerical summaries are made as well such as the total number of nucleotides, N50, the number of sequences, and the median for these histograms.
Examples are provided on how to output these graphical summaries to \*.png format and publication quality \*.tiff format.
